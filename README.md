## Justification
***

Developing skills and knowledge in navigation is very important for a researcher in the field of robotics, in view of the growth of mobile robotics applied to the theme "robots in terrestrial environment", it is necessary to develop mechanisms that solidify knowledge in a practical way. Concepts such as *SLAM, State-machine, computer vision and localization* are quite recurrent in this context, so, the **Heavy Hull** challenge proposes the systematic application of these concepts in order to strengthen future developments.

## Objective
***
The objective is to carry out the [mission](#mission) obeying the [prerequisites](#prerequisites).
